.SH NAME
update-ca-certificates \- update system CA certificates
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B update-ca-certificates
.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBupdate-ca-certificates\fP is intended to keep the certificate stores of
various components in sync with the system CA certificates.
.PP
The canonical source of CA certificates is what p11-kit knows about.
By default p11-kit looks into /usr/share/pki/anchors
resp /etc/pki/trust/anchors but there could be other plugins that
serve as source for certificates as well.
.PP
To blacklist certificates symlinks to the respective certificates
can be placed in /etc/pki/trust/blacklist
.PP
\fBupdate-ca-certificates\fP invokes
custom hooks in /usr/lib/ca-certificates/update.d/*.run and
/etc/ca-certificates/update.d/*.run to generate various certificate storages as
used by differnt programs. The command line options used for invoking
update-ca-certificates are passed to the hooks as well.
